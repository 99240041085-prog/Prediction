# Student Grade Predictor with AI Impact Analysis

This project predicts student academic performance based on AI tool usage and study habits. It specifically analyzes the **impact of AI** by comparing predicted scores with and without AI usage.

## Features
- **Predict Final Score**: Estimates the student's final exam score (0-100).
- **AI Impact Analysis**: Calculates how much AI usage improves (or hurts) the score.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, responsive dark-themed interface.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses a RandomForestRegressor trained on student performance data.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Flask backend API.
- `train_model.py`: Script to train the ML model.
- `model.pkl`: Saved trained model (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `templates/index.html`: Frontend HTML interface.
- `static/style.css`: CSS styling.
- `static/script.js`: Frontend logic and animations.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. (Optional) Retrain the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   *Note: A pre-trained `model.pkl` is already included.*

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser at:
   `http://localhost:5000`

3. Enter your AI usage details and academic stats to see the prediction.
